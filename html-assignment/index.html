    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Jowin Jose from India. I chose to take this course because of my strong interest in and excitement for the future of computer science, having studied the subject for 12 years. 
        I think there are a ton of fascinating possibilities for development and innovation in this subject, along with huge potential.

    <p>
        I also want to be a film editor because I'm really interested in filmmaking. Film editing is the soul of movies, and I have a strong desire to use this art form to tell compelling tales. My goal is to play a significant role in the film industry.
